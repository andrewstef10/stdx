     * @brief Parses the C-string str interpreting its content as an integral number of the specified base, which is returned as a long int value.
     * 
     * The function first discards as many whitespace characters as necessary until the first non-whitespace character is found.
     * Then, starting from this character, takes as many characters as possible that are valid following a syntax that depends on the base parameter, and interprets them as a numerical value.
     * Finally, a pointer to the first character following the integer representation in str is stored in the object pointed by endptr.
     * 
     * If the value of base is zero, the syntax expected is similar to that of integer constants, which is formed by a succession of:
     * - An optional sign character (+ or -)
     * - An optional prefix indicating octal or hexadecimal base ("0" or "0x"/"0X" respectively)
     * - A sequence of decimal digits (if no base prefix was specified) or either octal or hexadecimal digits if a specific prefix is present
     * 
     * If the base value is between 2 and 36, the format expected for the integral number is a succession of any of the valid digits and/or letters needed to represent integers of the specified radix (starting from '0' and up to 'z'/'Z' for radix 36).
     * The sequence may optionally be preceded by a sign (either + or -) and, if base is 16, an optional "0x" or "0X" prefix.
     *
     * @param str C-string beginning with the representation of an integral number.
     * @param base Numerical base (radix) that determines the valid characters and their interpretation.
     *             If this is 0, the base used is determined by the format in the sequence (see above).
     *             Default param option is base 10 (decimal).
     * @param endptr Reference to an object of type char*, whose value is set by the function to the next character in str after the numerical value.
     *               This parameter can also be a null pointer (default param option), in which case it is not used.
     * @return absolute value of the input
